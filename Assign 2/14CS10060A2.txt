DBMS queries fired from a Programming language
____________________________________________

Language used -- python

Dependencies -- pymysql

The code is written in Python. It uses the package MySQLdb which can be installed by sudo pip install MySQLdb

The code uses the database on my server account(database name:14CS10060,Password:Btech14)

I have commented out codes for creating tables and inserting values as those are done already in my database. In case tables are not present, those codes can be uncommented.

To run the code ,just type: python 14CS10060A2.py


Steps for establishing connection and firing queries:
_____________________________________________________

1) Establishing connection:
______________________________

We use the following command to establish a connection with the database
db = pymysql.connect("10.5.18.102","14CS10060","btech14","14CS10060")

1st argument-location address 
2nd argument -username
3rd argument -password
4th argument - name of the database
There may be a 5th argument that specifies the return type of the query.By default it returns a tuple.


The above command establishes a connection and throws an exception in case the database cannot be connected for issues like network unreachable or due to wrong username, password or database name.

2) Declaring a query:
________________________
Query is a simple string.
for example, query = 'select * from student'

3) Declaring a cursor :
_________________________
In order to execute a query we need a cursor object.
Declared as, c = db.cursor()    (where, db is the connection object)

4) Executing query:
__________________
The cursor declared above is used to execute a query.
c.execute(query)

5) Fetching results:
______________________________________
To retrieve data we use the fetchall() method.
result = c.fetchall()

It stores the tuples  and are printed just as in mysql.
